I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/english/), under the supervision of Stefan Sommer and Mads Nielsen, working on implicit and explicit data augmentation of human brain MRIs using deep generative models. My project is in partnership with [Cerebriu A/S](https://www.cerebriu.com/), a Danish startup that delivers AI solutions to radiologists. The project is supported by [Innovation Fund Denmark](https://innovationsfonden.dk/en), which promotes the invention and deployment of advanced technologies in Denmark.

I hold postgraduate degrees (M.A. and C.Phil) in pure mathematics from the University of California, San Diego. I did research there, applying the representation theory of semi-simple Lie groups to variational problems in conformal geometry. 

I was a Fellow in the [Insight Artificial Intelligence Fellows Program](https://www.insightdata.ai/) in New York City, an intensive seven-week immersion into the local data science scene. Insight is a *pre-start-up* experience, in which participants develop data science software in an agile environment; give demonstrations of minimum viable data science products to companies; and lecture about algorithms, data structures, and software engineering practices. While at Insight, I developed an [open-source deep learning pipeline](https://github.com/admshumar/insight-face-erase) for obscuring human faces in visual media.

Before Insight, I worked at the [International Dual Career Network](http://www.idcn.info/), where I produced insights about its members' desired job placements in Denmark.
